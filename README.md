# Leumbot

Leumbot is simply a small, self-hosted, bot that I want to run in a docker container on my home UnRaid machine (http://lime-technology.com/)

Leubot is written on top of the discord.py library, which requires Python 3.4+.

# How Do I Run this Bad Bot?

Assuming you have some development experience you can run the bot in a docker container.
